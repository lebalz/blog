# Speedup Build Time on Drone CI

I use drone ci to build and deploy my github pages. Like that i don't have to wait for a free github runner and have a more or less constant build time. My initial Pipeline had three stages:

{/* truncate */}

The `website` Stage, where the static page is compiled with Webpacker, consumed the most time. No big deal for pages with few dependencies (e.g. a clean install of Docusaurus), where a complete build takes around 1 minute on a [Hetzner CPX41](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) (8 VCPUs, *AMD EPYC 2nd* with 16 GB Ram). But for pages with many dependecies it took me around 8 minutes for the page to be built.

So i decided to add caching to my pipeline. Since memory on my server isn't a problem for the moment, i'm using *volume cache* directly on my server. To do so, i configured the `.drony.yml` file with two additional stages:

I used the [drone-volume-cache](https://github.com/Drillster/drone-volume-cache) from [@drillster](https://github.com/Drillster) and followed the instructions on the [docs page](https://github.com/Drillster/drone-volume-cache/blob/master/DOCS.md).

## Configure Drone Server

Because my drone ci is deployed with [Dokku](https://lebalz/synopsis/dokku/drone-ci), the cache will be typically under `/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/<app-name>`.

```bash
# create persistent directory for caching
mkdir -p /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/drone-runner/cache
```

The drone server itself will spawn the drone runner with a mounted volume. To do so, the repository, needs to be "Trusted". This flag can only be set as an admin. So ensure you configured yourself as an admin:

```bash
# replace foobar with your github username
dokku config:set drone-server DRONE_USER_CREATE=username:foobar,admin:true
```

And set the trusted flag under `Settings>General>Project Settings` for the repository you like to cache:

## `.drone.yml`

Finally, add the highlighted code blocks to your drone config file.  
```yml {3-11,14-22,25-28}
steps:
# first step
- name: restore-cache
  image: drillster/drone-volume-cache
  volumes:
  - name: cache
    path: /cache
  settings:
    restore: true
    mount:
      - ./node_modules
# ...
# last step
- name: rebuild-cache
  image: drillster/drone-volume-cache
  volumes:
  - name: cache
    path: /cache
  settings:
    rebuild: true
    mount:
      - ./node_modules
# ...
# add volume
volumes:
  - name: cache
    host:
      path: /var/lib/dokku/data/storage/drone-runner/cache
```

## Conclusion ðŸš€

With the added cache stages, the build time on my big page could be reduced from 8 minutes to 3:30 minutes ðŸš€. For lightweight pages it takes now around 15 seconds for a small change to be deployed, yay ðŸ¥³
