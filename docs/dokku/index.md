# Dokku

> Dokku is a software suite that simulates a PaaS on any server. It uses the same base functionality as Heroku and tries to mimic usage of Heroku as much as possible. With Dokku, itâ€™s very easy to deploy software and run multiple projects on the same physical server through the use of containers. [^1]
